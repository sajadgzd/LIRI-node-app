# LIRI-node-app
LIRI is a command line app using node packages that takes in parameters and gives you back data

### What Each Command Should Do

1. `node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>`

   * This will search the Bands in Town Artist Events API for an artist and render the following information about each event to the terminal:

     * Name of the venue

     * Venue location

     * Date of the Event (use moment to format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")

2. `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`

   * This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window

     * Artist(s)

     * The song's name

     * A preview link of the song from Spotify

     * The album that the song is from

   * If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign".

   * It will utilize the [node-spotify-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api) package in order to retrieve song information from the Spotify API.

   * The Spotify API requires you sign up as a developer to generate the necessary credentials. You can follow these steps in order to generate a **client id** and **client secret**:

   * Step One: Visit <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/>

   * Step Two: Either login to your existing Spotify account or create a new one (a free account is fine) and log in.

   * Step Three: Once logged in, navigate to <https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create> to register a new application to be used with the Spotify API. You can fill in whatever you'd like for these fields. When finished, click the "complete" button.

   * Step Four: On the next screen, scroll down to where you see your client id and client secret. Copy these values down somewhere, you'll need them to use the Spotify API and the [node-spotify-api package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api).

3. `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'`

   * This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

     ```
       * Title of the movie.
       * Year the movie came out.
       * IMDB Rating of the movie.
       * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
       * Country where the movie was produced.
       * Language of the movie.
       * Plot of the movie.
       * Actors in the movie.
     ```

   * If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'

     * If you haven't watched "Mr. Nobody," then you should: <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/>

     * It's on Netflix!

   * You'll use the `axios` package to retrieve data from the OMDB API.

4. `node liri.js do-what-it-says`

   * Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

     * It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.



* In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called `log.txt`.
